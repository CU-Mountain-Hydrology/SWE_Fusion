Figure 1 below displays estimated SWE amounts across the Western United States. Detailed SWE maps (in JPG format) and summaries of SWE (in Excel format) by individual basin and elevation band accompany the report and are publicly available \href{https://github.com/CU-Mountain-Hydrology/WestWide}{here}. Please note that the basin-wide percent of long-term average from the spatial SWE estimates is not directly comparable with the SNOTEL basin-wide percent of average. A better comparison might be made with the percent of average in the elevation banded tables (linked below) that contain SNOTEL sites.\\

\noindent\textbf{\textit{About this report}}\\
This is an experimental research product that provides near-real-time estimates of snow-water equivalent (SWE) at a spatial resolution of 500 meters for the Western region of the United States from mid-winter through the melt season. The report is typically released within a week of the date of data acquisition at the top of the report. A similar report covering the Sierra Nevada has been distributed to water managers in California since 2012.\\

\noindent
The spatial SWE data fusion (SWE-fusion) analysis method for the Western U.S. uses the following data as inputs:
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
    \item In-situ SWE from all operational NRCS and CDEC snow pillow sites, and the CoCoRaHS network when appropriate
    \item Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) data from recent cloud-free satellite images
    \item Physiographic information (elevation, latitude, upwind mountain barriers, slope, etc.)
    \item Historical daily SWE patterns (1985-2021) retrospectively generated using historical fSCA data and an energy-balance model that back-calculates SWE given the fSCA time-series and meltout date for each pixel
    \item Satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA)
\end{itemize}

\noindent For more details see the \hyperref[sec:methods]{\textcolor{black}{\textit{Methods}}} section below. Please be sure to read the \hyperref[sec:data_issues]{\textcolor{black}{\textit{Data Issues / Caveats}}} section for a discussion of persistent challenges or flagged uncertainties of the SWE-fusion product.\\

\newpage
\noindent\textbf{\textit{Data availability for reporting}}\\
Snow pillows located throughout the Western U.S. region are input as the dependent variable in the SWE-fusion system. 799 Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) Snow Telemetry (SNOTEL) sites and 131 California Department of Water Resources (CA-DWR) California Data Exchange Center (CDEC) are potentially available for each model run. In addition, the Community Collaborative Rain, Hail and Snow (CoCoRaHS, https://www.cocorahs.org/) network provides over 500 snow measurements across the modeling domain.\\

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Maps and Tables by Region}}\\
Maps and tables for each of the five western regions (\hyperref[fig:1b]{\textcolor{black}{Figure 1b}}) are shown below. Note that the basin-wide averages may reflect variable conditions across the elevation bands; see banded-elevation tables (linked below). Basin-wide percent of average is calculated across all model pixels inside a given basin and base elevation. Basin base elevations vary anywhere between 2,000’ to 7,000’. Base elevations are dependent on long-term snow coverage. For example, a base elevation in the north could be lower as compared to a base elevation in the south.\\

\noindent\textbf{\textit{The value of spatially explicit estimates of SWE}}\\
\fontsize{10}{14}
\noindent Snowmelt makes up the large majority (\textasciitilde60-85\%) of the annual streamflow in the Western U.S. The spatial distribution of SWE across the landscape is complex. While broad aspects of this spatial pattern (e.g., more SWE at higher elevations and on north-facing exposures) are fairly consistent, the details vary a lot from year to year, influencing the magnitude and timing of snowmelt-driven runoff.\\

\noindent SWE is operationally monitored at hundreds of NRCS SNOTEL and California DWR CDEC snow pillow sites spread across the Western U.S., providing a critical first-order snapshot of conditions, and the basis for runoff forecasts from the CA DWR, NRCS and NOAA. However, conditions at snow pillow sites (e.g., percent of normal SWE) may not be representative of conditions in the large areas between these point measurements, and at elevations above and below the range of the pillow sites. The spatial SWE-fusion creates a detailed picture of the spatial pattern of SWE using snow pillows, satellite, and other data, extending beyond the snow pillow sites to unmonitored areas.\\

\fontsize{12}{16}
\noindent\textbf{\textit{Interpreting the spatial SWE estimates in the context of snow pillow sites}}\\
\fontsize{10}{14}
\noindent The spatial SWE-fusion product estimates SWE for every pixel where the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) satellite product identifies snow-cover. Comparatively, snow pillow samples on average 8-20 points per basin within a narrower elevation range. Thus, the basin-wide percent of long-term average from the spatial SWE-fusion estimates is not directly comparable with the snow pillow basin-wide percent of average. A better comparison might be made with the \% average in the elevation bands (\href{https://github.com/CU-Mountain-Hydrology/WestWide}{\underline{elevation-banded tables 6-10}}) that contain snow pillow sites.\\

\section*{}\label{sec:methods}\vspace{-3em}
\fontsize{12}{16}
\noindent\textbf{\textit{Methods}}\\
\fontsize{10}{14}
\noindent The spatial SWE-fusion estimation method is described in Yang, et. al. (2022) and Schneider and Molotch (2016). The method uses a General Linear Model in which the dependent variable is derived from the operationally measured in situ SWE from all online NRCS SNOTEL and CDEC snow pillow sites in the domain and when applicable the CoCoRaHS SWE values. The snow pillow SWE observations are scaled by the satellite-based fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) across the 500-meter pixel containing that snow pillow site before being used in the linear regression model. The fSCA is a near-real-time cloud-free daily satellite image from the Snow Today fSCA image (Rittger, et. al. 2019, \href{https://nsidc.org/snow-today}{\underline{https://nsidc.org/snow-today}}) which uses the SPIReS algorithm (Bair, et al. 2021).\\

\noindent The following independent variables (predictors) enter the linear regression model:
\begin{itemize}[label=-]
    \item Physiographic variables that affect snow accumulation, melt, and redistribution, including elevation, latitude, upwind mountain barriers, slope, and others. See Table 1 in Yang, et. al., (2022) for the full set of these variables.
    \item The historical daily SWE pattern (1985-2021) retrospectively generated using historical Landsat data, and an energy-balance model that back-calculates SWE given the fractional Snow-Covered Area (fSCA) time series and meltout date for each pixel. See Fang, et. al., (2022) for details. (For computational efficiency, only one image during the 1985-2021 period that best matches the real-time snow pillow-observed pattern is selected as an independent variable.)
    \item Satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA) derived from Rittger, et. al., (2019) data.
\end{itemize}

\noindent The real-time regression model for this date has been validated by cross-validation, whereby 10\% of the snow pillow data are randomly removed and the model prediction is compared to the measured value at the removed snow pillow stations. This is repeated 30 times to obtain an average R-squared value, which denotes how closely the model fits the snow pillow data. During development of this regression method, the model was also validated against independent historical SWE data from Airborne Snow Observatory lidar data and from snow surveys at 10 locations in Colorado.\\


\section*{}\label{sec:data_issues}\vspace{-3em}
\fontsize{12}{16}
\noindent\textbf{\textit{List of All Known Data Issues/Caveats}}
\fontsize{10}{14}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SATELLITE FSCA - Recent snowpack accumulation particularly in the Arizona / NM region may be under-estimated due to issues with satellite-observed fSCA.
    \item GLACIER \& NON-SEASONAL SNOW – SWE values on non-seasonal snow and glaciers need to be excluded before data analysis.
    \item RECENT SNOWFALL – There are occasionally problems with lower-elevation SWE estimates due to recent snowfall events that result in extensive snow-cover extending to valley locations where measurements are not available. This scenario results in an over-estimation of lower- elevation SWE.
    \item LIMITED SNOW PILLOW DATA – When snow at the snow pillow sites melts out, but remains at higher elevations, the model tends to overestimate SWE at the under-monitored upper elevations. This issue typically occurs late in the melt season, resulting in less accurate SWE prediction at higher elevations compared to earlier in the snow season. 
    \item CLOUD COVER – Cloud cover can obscure satellite measurements of snow-cover. While careful checks are made, occasionally the misclassification of clouds as snow or vice versa may result in the mischaracterization of SWE or bare-ground.
    \item LOW LOOK ANGLE – When a satellite does not pass directly over a region but the area is still included within the satellite sensor’s field of view, this is referred to as a low “look angle”. The resulting image has lower effective resolution – this “blurry” MODSCAG data still contains useful information but may lead to overestimation of SWE near the margins of the snow-cover extent.
    \item POOR QUALITY SNOW SENSOR DATA – Although data QA/QC is performed, occasional SNOTEL sensor malfunction may result in localized SWE errors.
    \item ANOMALOUS SNOW PATTERNS – Anomalous snow years or snow distributions may cause SWE error due to the model design to search for similar SWE distributions from previous years. If no close seasonal analogue exists, the model is forced to find the most similar year, which may result in error.
    \item DENSE FOREST COVER – Dense forest cover at lower elevations where snow-cover is discontinuous can cause the satellite to underestimate the snow-cover extent, leading to underestimation of SWE.
    \item PERCENT OF AVERAGE CALCULATIONS - Data utilized to generate this report change to optimize model performance.  To maintain consistency across the historical record, the percent of average values are based on our baseline algorithm and therefore there can be discrepancies between absolute SWE values and corresponding percent of averages.
    \item MODELING METHODS - We work to generate the best SWE estimates for each reporting date. Our methods can change from one report to another. Sometimes data changes between reports is an artifact of method changes.
    \item EARLY SEASON FSCA ERRORS – The gap-filled fSCA requires some cloud-free images to determine fSCA amounts. Early in the season and if it has been particularly cloudy the algorithm hasn’t had time to calculate fSCA amounts in some areas, typically in the Pacific Northwest and northern areas of the domain.
