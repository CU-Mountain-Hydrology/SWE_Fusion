\noindent\textbf{\textit{About this report}}\\
This is an experimental research product that provides near-real-time estimates of snow-water equivalent (SWE) at a spatial resolution of 500 meters for the Sierra Nevada in California from mid-winter through the melt season. The report is typically released within a week of the date of data acquisition at the top of the report. A similar report covering the entire Western United States is available and is distributed to water managers across the Western U.S.

\noindent The spatial SWE-fusion analysis method for the Sierra Nevada uses the following data as inputs:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] In-situ SWE from all operational CA and NV snow pillow sensor sites and CoCoRaHS SWE values when available and applicable
    \item[-] Fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) data from recent cloud-free satellite images or model
    \item[-] Physiographic information (elevation, latitude, upwind mountain barriers, slope, etc.)
    \item[-] Historical daily SWE patterns (1985-2021) retrospectively generated using historical fSCA data and an energy-balance model that back-calculates SWE given the fSCA time-series and meltout date for each pixel
    \item[-] Satellite-observed daily mean fractional snow-covered area (DMFSCA)
\end{itemize}

\noindent For more details on the estimation method see the \hyperref[sec:methods]{\textit{\textcolor{black}{Methods}}} section below. Please be sure to read the \hyperref[sec:data_issues]{\textit{\textcolor{black}{Data Issues / Caveats}}} section for a discussion of persistent challenges or uncertainties of the SWE product.\\

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Data availability in this report}}\\
There are a total of 131 snow pillow sites in the Sierra Nevada network that are used by the SWE-fusion model and when applicable there are typically 10-20 CoCoRaHS measurements that can be used. Sites that are recording SWE, offline sites, sites recording zero, and CoCoRaHS measurements are shown in \hyperref[sec:figure_7]{\textcolor{black}{Figure 7}}, on the left map (shown in black, red, yellow, and green respectively).\\

\noindent\textbf{\textit{The value of spatially explicit estimates of SWE}}\\
Snowmelt makes up the large majority (\textasciitilde60-85\%) of the annual streamflow in the Sierra Nevada. The spatial distribution of snow-water equivalent (SWE) across the landscape is complex. While broad aspects of this spatial pattern (e.g., more SWE at higher elevations and on north-facing exposures) are fairly consistent, the details vary a lot from year to year, influencing the magnitude and timing of snowmelt-driven runoff.\\

\noindent SWE is operationally monitored at more than 130 snow pillow sensor sites spread across the Sierra Nevada, providing a critical first-order snapshot of conditions, and the basis for runoff forecasts from the CA DWR, NRCS, and NOAA. However, conditions at snow pillow sites (e.g., percent of normal SWE) may not be representative of conditions in the large areas between these point measurements, and at elevations above and below the range of the sensor sites. The spatial snow analysis creates a detailed picture of the spatial pattern of SWE using snow sensors, satellite, and other data, extending beyond the snow sensor sites to unmonitored areas.\\

\noindent\textbf{\textit{Interpreting the spatial SWE estimates in the context of snow pillows}}\\
The spatial product estimates SWE for every pixel where the fSCA product identifies snow-cover. Comparatively, snow sensor samples 8-20 points per basin within a narrower elevation range. Thus, the basin-wide percent of average from the spatial SWE estimates is not directly comparable with the snow sensor basin-wide percent of average. A better comparison might be made with the percent of average in the elevation bands (\hyperref[sec:table_2]{\textcolor{black}{Table 2}}) that contain snow sensor sites.

\section*{}\label{sec:methods}
\noindent\textbf{\textit{Methods}}\\
The spatial SWE-fusion estimation method is described in Yang, et al. (2022) and Schneider and Molotch (2016). The method uses a generalized linear regression in which the dependent variable is derived from the operationally measured in situ SWE from all online snow pillow sensor sites in the domain. The gridded model output is then scaled by the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA). The fSCA is a combination of a near-real-time gap-filled and cloud-free MODIS satellite image which has been processed using the Snow Today algorithm (Rittger, et al. 2019, \href{https://nsidc.org/snow-today}{\underline{https://nsidc.org/snow-today}}), the SPIReS algorithm (Bair, et al. 2021), and the MODIS cloud-gap-filled algorithm (Hall, et al. 2019).\\

\noindent The following independent variables (predictors) enter into the generalized linear regression model:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[-] Physiographic variables that affect snow accumulation, melt, and redistribution, including elevation, latitude, upwind mountain barriers, slope, and others. See Table 1 in Yang, et al. (2022) for the full set of these variables.
    \item[-] The historical daily SWE pattern (1985-2021) retrospectively generated using historical Landsat data, and an energy balance model that back-calculates SWE given the fractional snow-covered area (fSCA) time series and meltout date for each pixel. See Fang, et. al., (2022) for details. (For computational efficiency, only one image during the 1985-2021 period that best matches the real-time snow pillow-observed pattern is selected as an independent variable.)
\end{itemize}

\noindent The real-time regression SWE-fusion model for this date has been validated by cross-validation, whereby 10\% of the snow pillow data are randomly removed and the model prediction is compared to the measured value at the removed snow pillow stations. This is repeated 12 times to obtain an average $R^2$ value, which denotes how closely the model fits the snow pillow data. During development of this regression method, the model was also validated against independent historical SWE data collected in snow surveys at 9 locations in Colorado, and an intensive field survey in north-central Colorado. Data utilized to generate this report change to optimize model performance. To maintain consistency across the historical record, the percent of average values are based on our baseline algorithm and therefore there can be discrepancies between absolute SWE values and corresponding percent of averages.\\

\section*{}\label{sec:data_issues}
\noindent\textbf{\textit{List of All Known Data Issues/Caveats – any of these could apply to this model run}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item SATELLITE FSCA – Recent snowpack accumulation may be under-estimated due to issues with satellite-observed fSCA.
    \item NEW AVERAGE CALCULATIONS – Average calculations are based on 2001-2025 model values, which includes both drought years (2012-2016) and the 2023 record snow year. This can impact our percent of averages in comparison to other products.
    \item RECENT SNOWFALL – There are occasionally problems with lower-elevation SWE estimates due to recent snowfall events that result in extensive snow-cover extending to valley locations where measurements are not available. This scenario results in an over-estimation of lower-elevation SWE.
    \item LIMITED SNOW PILLOW DATA – When snow at the snow pillow sites melts out, but remains at higher elevations, the model tends to underestimate SWE at the under-monitored upper elevations. This issue typically occurs late in the melt season, resulting in less accurate SWE prediction at higher elevations compared to earlier in the snow season.
    \item CLOUD COVER – Cloud cover can obscure satellite measurements of snow-cover. While careful checks are made, occasionally the misclassification of clouds as snow or vice versa may result in the mischaracterization of SWE or bare ground.
    \item POOR QUALITY SNOW SENSOR DATA – Although data QA/QC is performed, occasional sensor malfunction may result in localized SWE errors.
    \item ANOMALOUS SNOW PATTERNS – Anomalous snow years or snow distributions may cause SWE error due to the model design to search for similar SWE distributions from previous years. If no close seasonal analogue exists, the model is forced to find the most similar year, which may result in error.
    \item DENSE FOREST COVER – Dense forest cover at lower elevations where snow-cover is discontinuous can cause the satellite to underestimate the snow-cover extent, leading to underestimation of SWE.
    \item MISSING SWE VALUES – Data omitted due to inconsistencies with independent SWE estimates.
    \item PERCENT OF AVERAGE CALCULATIONS – Data utilized to generate this report change to optimize model performance. To maintain consistency across the historical record, the percent of average values are based on our baseline algorithm and therefore there can be discrepancies between absolute SWE values and corresponding percent of averages.
    \item MODELING METHODS – We work to generate the best SWE estimates for each reporting date. Our methods can change from one report to another. Sometimes data changes between reports is an artifact of method changes.
