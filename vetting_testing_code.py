# load raster


# get snotels within the raster

# flag if SNM or WW
## get sensors from df in the sensor code


## get percent error on sensors
## get MAE

## if there's surveys
## get percent error on survyes
## get MAE

## if there is an ASO data within 2 days
## get percent error be elevation and

## compare SWE volume be basin from previous report
## figure out if it's increasing or decreasing
## determin if the pillows are increasing
## flag if there is a mismatch

### FOR WW
## get really high values -- within x standard deviations of the max value
## give a shapefile adn find out which basins are there
