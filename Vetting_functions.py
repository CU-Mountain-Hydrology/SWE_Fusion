# import modules

# get sensor data for extent of raster
# get raster value
# get % error per sensor and average
# output error per sensor in one csv
# output average error basins on zone
    ## could be by domain, or basin

# check to see if there is an ASO flight within 3 days
## calcuate % error and % error by elevation band

# check file size
    ## if it's less than the lowest one from last year, have a flag
    ## plot it and prompt you on whether to continue

# have a flag for high values
    # print out the basin and the values per elevation band on if we should edit them
